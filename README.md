## 📖 Project Description  
This project is a **career transformation initiative** designed to:  
1. Build expertise in the **semiconductor ecosystem & TPM skillset**.  
2. Demonstrate TPM competencies by treating this journey like a **real-world project**.  
3. Deliver a **portfolio artifact** that proves ability to plan, execute, and manage risk.  

---

## 🎯 Purpose & Justification  
> ⚡ **Why now?**  
The semiconductor industry is at the center of innovation. Companies need **TPMs who understand both business + technology**.  
This roadmap accelerates my transition into a **TPM role within 6–7 months**, while also building a **showcase portfolio** of TPM skills.  

---

## ✅ Objectives (SMART Goals)  
- 📘 Build **domain knowledge** in the semiconductor ecosystem by **Sept 2025**.  
- 📊 Produce **3–4 TPM-style case studies/projects** by **Dec 2025**.  
- 🤝 Secure **5+ informational interviews & 2+ networking events** by **Jan 2026**.  
- 💼 Apply to **20 high-fit TPM roles** and target **3+ interviews** by **project close**.  

---

## 📦 Scope  
**In-Scope:**  
✔️ Semiconductor ecosystem learning (business models, key players, growth areas)  
✔️ Building dashboards, roadmaps, case studies  
✔️ Networking & targeted job applications  

**Out-of-Scope:**  
❌ Deep technical engineering unrelated to TPM  
❌ Budget-heavy certifications not directly aligned with TPM transition
