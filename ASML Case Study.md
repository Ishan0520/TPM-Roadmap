## ðŸ“Š ASML Integrated Case Study Table

| **Topic** | **Details & Insights** |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Founding & Early History** | Founded in 1984 in the Netherlands by Philips and ASM International. Initially focused on lithography equipment for semiconductor fabrication. |
| **Strategic Shift â†’ EUV Leadership** | Transitioned from **DUV (deep ultraviolet) lithography â†’ EUV (extreme ultraviolet)**. EUV enables 5nm, 3nm, and future node production, giving ASML a near-monopoly on leading-edge lithography. |
| **Financial Scale & Dominance** | - FY2024 revenue: **â‚¬28.6B (~$31B)**, up ~20% YoY. <br> - Gross margin: ~50%. <br> - ~35,000 employees globally. <br> - Customers: TSMC, Samsung, Intel, GlobalFoundries, SK Hynix. <br> - Market position: **only supplier of high-volume EUV lithography systems**. |
| **Business Architecture (Today)** | **High-tech semiconductor equipment + software + services**: <br> - Hardware: EUV and DUV lithography machines, precision optics, scanners. <br> - Software: yield optimization, throughput monitoring, simulation, and control systems. <br> - Services: maintenance, upgrades, global support for fab operations. <br> - R&D: advanced light sources, optics, and system integration. |
| **Core Segments** | 1. **EUV Lithography** â€“ critical for 7nm, 5nm, 3nm node production. <br> 2. **DUV Lithography** â€“ mature nodes (28nm+). <br> 3. **Metrology & Software** â€“ wafer inspection, throughput optimization. <br> 4. **Services & Support** â€“ uptime, maintenance, upgrades, training. |
| **Roadmap / Future Architectures** | - **High-NA EUV (~2025â€“2026)**: enables 2nm nodes and below. <br> - **Throughput & yield optimization**: advanced software, AI/ML-assisted process control. <br> - **EUV Source & Optics Innovation**: higher power, better stability, defect reduction. <br> - **Next-generation metrology**: in-line defect detection, predictive maintenance. <br> - **Global fab enablement**: supporting multi-vendor fabs with integration expertise. |
| **Compute & Manufacturing Requirements** | EUV systems require **extreme precision, cleanroom environments, vacuum optics, and advanced metrology**. Each machine is an **ultra-high-tech project**, managed across multiple teams and suppliers. |
| **Market Positioning & Moat** | - Moat = **technology leadership + IP + ecosystem lock-in**. <br> - Near-monopoly on high-NA EUV lithography. <br> - Strategic partnerships: TSMC, Samsung, Intel, Zeiss (optics), Trumpf (laser sources). <br> - Differentiators: R&D intensity, precision engineering, global fab enablement. |
| **Supply Chain & Risks** | - Highly complex global supply chain (optics, lasers, motion systems). <br> - Geopolitical risks: export control regulations, Taiwan/China tensions, US/EU technology policies. <br> - Lead-time and cost of EUV systems are very high (~$150M+ per machine). |
| **Regulation / Policy** | - Export restrictions on advanced lithography equipment (US/EU). <br> - Compliance with semiconductor manufacturing standards. <br> - Environmental and safety regulations for high-power laser systems. |
| **Competition & Threats** | - Nikon and Canon (DUV lithography). <br> - Emerging EUV alternatives (but currently no commercial competitors). <br> - Geopolitical / regulatory barriers limiting customer markets. |
| **SWOT Snapshot** | **Strengths**: EUV leadership, advanced R&D, strong customer relationships. <br> **Weaknesses**: high-cost machines, limited suppliers for optics/lasers. <br> **Opportunities**: high-NA EUV, metrology software, AI-assisted fab optimization. <br> **Threats**: geopolitical restrictions, supply chain bottlenecks, emerging lithography tech. |
